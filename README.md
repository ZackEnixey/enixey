#React + Redux Starter Project
---
This project was created as a starting point for React projects (using create-react-app) with Redux and Redux-Thunk. It is based off the tutorial [here](https://code.likeagirl.io/tutorial-for-adding-redux-to-a-react-app-1a94cc1738e5). The tutorial was meant as a guide and does not provide working code. This project follows that guide, with updates to eliminate bugs, and get the project fully running.

To adapt this code to call your own API, you will need to update the proxy in `/package.json` and the fetch url in `/src/actions/stuffActions.js`.
